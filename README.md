# calculator

> A calculator project

Here's a calculator app built with Vue.js, with Jest unit tests and Nightwatch e2e tests.
This is an interactive calculator that can be used with button clicking as well as the keyboard. The ? button shows you the shortcuts for each button. Number buttons map directly with their keyboard values. This is screen reader friendly as well.
